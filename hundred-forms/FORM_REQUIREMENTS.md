# Requirements
All of the forms in this folder is a kinda challenge, so the main rule of the challendge is ALL forms should be done not more than in 30 minutes. Here I'll try to do my best in development of html forms, try to develop 100 different forms as fast as I can. The point is I strongly believe that typical average html form markup development shold take no more than 30 minutes. Without predefined styles & presets from npm and the like. At the end I should more or less be able to produce forms containing let's say 6 to 8 controls in only thirty minutes

## The rules
1. Perfect form should contain:  
    a) alerts box for each control as well as notification by color (of border) in case of invalid
    b) 3 types of controls  (file | select | radio | checkboxes)
    c) Icons  
    d) Labels and placeholders
2. At the end it should be possible to make inline, labeled, aligned, unaligned forms within 30 min
3. Forms should support last 2 versions of all popular browsers.
4. All forms should be rtl ltr compatible   
6. Mobile compatible
